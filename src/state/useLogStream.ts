/**
 * Opens a Rust log stream and guarantees teardown.
 *
 * **A Tauri channel does not clean itself up.** It releases its callback only
 * when Rust sends an end message; there is no unsubscribe in the JS API, and
 * releasing a JS callback would not stop the Rust producer anyway. Without
 * explicit teardown every visit to a streaming screen leaves a live producer,
 * and tab-switching accumulates them.
 *
 * Two details that are easy to omit and expensive to debug:
 *
 * - **Unmount can beat subscribe.** Fast tab switching runs cleanup before the
 *   registering invoke has returned, so a handle arriving after cancellation is
 *   torn down immediately. Handled once here rather than per screen.
 * - **Both promises are caught.** A rejected teardown would otherwise surface
 *   as an unhandled rejection with no stack pointing at the screen that caused
 *   it.
 *
 * Cancelling stops *delivery*, never the operation: leaving `connecting` does
 * not disconnect the mesh, and leaving `settled` does not abort a settlement.
