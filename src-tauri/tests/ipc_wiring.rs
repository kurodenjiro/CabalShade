//! IPC-layer checks against Tauri's mock runtime.
//!
//! # What this can and cannot prove
//!
//! It was written to catch a state-type mismatch — Tauri resolves
//! `State<'_, T>` by type at runtime, so a wrong type is a **panic inside the
//! IPC handler**, not a compile error, and ticket 14 changed that type from
//! `Arc<Mutex<AppState>>` to `AppState`.
//!
//! It does not prove that. The ACL runs *before* state resolution, and
//! `mock_context` carries no resolved capabilities, so every invoke is denied
//! before a command body is reached. Plumbing real capabilities into a mock
//! context is more machinery than the check is worth.
//!
//! State resolution is verified instead by running the app against the dev
//! server and observing a frontend-originated command in the logs — see
//! `docs/mobile-build-verification.md`. Note that the debug binary is built
//! with `cfg(dev)`, so without Vite serving `devUrl` the webview loads nothing
//! and *no* frontend command runs. That is easy to mistake for a broken IPC
//! layer.
//!
//! What remains here is worth keeping: it shows the ACL from ticket 06 is
//! enforced on the real invoke path, and that commands are registered.
