//! A handle onto the mesh actor.
//!
//! # Why an actor
//!
//! `libp2p::Swarm` is not `Sync`, so it must live in exactly one task. That is
//! not a limitation to work around — it is the correct shape for a component
//! driving a single event loop. Everything else talks to it by message.
//!
//! # Why the channel is bounded
//!
//! The previous channel was unbounded. A UI that spams an action — a user
//! holding "refresh nodes", or a retry loop that never backs off — would grow
//! the queue until the process is killed, and on a 2 GB phone that arrives
//! quickly. A bounded channel turns the same situation into backpressure: the
//! caller waits, or gets a typed error, and the device stays alive.
//!
//! # What lives here and what does not
//!
//! The handle carries *requests*. Events flowing the other way — peers
//! discovered, intents received — stay on the existing event channel to the
//! frontend, because they are broadcast rather than request/response.
