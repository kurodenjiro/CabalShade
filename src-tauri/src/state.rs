//! Application state.
//!
//! # What was wrong before
//!
//! State was a single `Arc<Mutex<AppState>>`. Every command locked it, then
//! locked a second mutex inside it, then awaited network I/O while holding
//! both. Two concurrent RPC calls therefore ran strictly one after the other:
//! the app had no concurrency at all, only the appearance of it.
//!
//! It was also managed *inside a spawned task*, so any command invoked before
//! bootstrap finished raced it. That failure is worse than it sounds — a
//! missing `State<'_, T>` is a **runtime panic inside the IPC handler**, not
//! an error a command can convert. The window was small, so it looked stable.
//!
//! # The shape now
//!
//! [`AppState`] is managed synchronously at startup, before the webview can
//! invoke anything. It is cheap to clone and holds no lock of its own; the
//! services inside it arrive later.
//!
//! Commands ask for [`AppState::services`], which is `Ok` once bootstrap has
//! completed and [`AppError::NotReady`] before then. That is the same state
//! the `connecting` screen already renders as progress, so "not ready" became
//! a value instead of a panic.
//!
//! # Why `std::sync::RwLock` and not the async one
//!
//! The critical sections here clone a handful of `Arc`s and return. Nothing is
//! held across an `.await`. Tauri's own guidance is that the standard-library
//! lock is preferred in async code unless a guard genuinely spans a suspension
//! point, and paying for an async lock to guard a pointer copy is exactly the
//! case it warns about.
