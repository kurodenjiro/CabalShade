//! Suspend and resume handling.
//!
//! # No custom plugin needed
//!
//! An earlier plan specified a native lifecycle plugin. That was written
//! against Tauri 2.9, where nothing propagated. **2.11 emits
//! `WindowEvent::Suspended` and `WindowEvent::Resumed` on mobile**, so the
//! plugin is obsolete before it was written.
//!
//! From the Tauri source, the mapping is:
//!
//! | | Suspended | Resumed |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Android | `Activity.onPause` | `Activity.onResume` (first one ignored) |
//! | iOS | `applicationWillResignActive` | `applicationWillEnterForeground` |
//! | Desktop | not emitted | not emitted |
//!
//! # The iOS asymmetry, and why teardown is conservative
//!
//! Those two iOS callbacks are **not** mirror images. `willResignActive` fires
//! for transient interruptions — the control centre, the notification shade, an
//! incoming call, a permission prompt — while `willEnterForeground` only fires
//! after actually leaving the background.
//!
//! So a pull-down of the notification shade delivers `Suspended` with no
//! matching `Resumed` until the app is genuinely backgrounded and returned to.
//! Anything torn down on suspend must therefore be cheap to lose and
//! reconstructed on demand, not only on resume — otherwise glancing at a
//! notification silently kills the mesh for the rest of the session.
//!
//! What this does on suspend is bounded accordingly: cancel live streams and
//! stop mesh participation. Both are re-established by the next subscribe or
//! publish, so the transient case self-heals. The swarm itself is deliberately
//! left running — see `MeshHandle::set_offline`.
