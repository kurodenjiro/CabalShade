//! The error type that crosses the IPC boundary.
//!
//! # What was wrong before
//!
//! Every command returned `Result<T, String>` built from `e.to_string()`. That
//! has two costs. The frontend cannot branch — it receives prose and can only
//! display it, so on-voice copy is impossible and any localisation is
//! impossible. And it leaks: `e.to_string()` on an I/O error contains the
//! filesystem path, on a transport error the RPC URL, and both travel to the
//! webview.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! [`AppError`] serializes as a discriminated union tagged on `kind`, so the
//! frontend switches on a variant and renders its own copy. The variant is the
//! contract; the sentence is not.
//!
//! # Redaction is the point, not a side effect
//!
//! Variants carry only what is safe to show. Anything diagnostic —
//! source chains, paths, URLs, key material — goes to the log, never to the
//! return value. [`AppError::internal`] exists to make that the easy path:
//! it consumes the real error and yields a variant that carries none of it.
//!
//! # Not yet wired
//!
//! Services still return their own error types; this lands the taxonomy and
//! its guarantees first so later tickets have somewhere to convert *to*. The
//! frozen desktop surface keeps `Result<T, String>` and flattens through
//! [`crate::legacy::adapt::flatten_error`].
