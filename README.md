> **The Zero-Identity Autonomous Layer for Mesh-to-Avalanche Private Intents**

A decentralized, privacy-first infrastructure enabling autonomous AI Agents to negotiate and execute transactions over a physical Mesh Network, settling on the Avalanche C-Chain (Fuji testnet by default).

## 🎥 Demo

## 🎯 Philosophy

In this network, you are a **Nobody**. Every trace—from your physical location (IP) and negotiation tactics to your on-chain financial footprint—is erased, leaving only a cryptographically verified result.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### The "Nobody" Stack (Privacy-in-Depth)

1. **The Cloak Layer** (Mesh Networking)
   - ShadowWire + Libp2p for offline peer-to-peer communication
   - mDNS discovery without internet dependency
   - Multi-hop metadata stripping

2. **The Invisible Brain** (Confidential Computation)
   - Ollama AI Agents with "Shark Mode" aggressive negotiation
   - Noir ZK-Circuits for privacy-preserving verification
   - Confidential Compute (FHE/MPC) integration ready

3. **The Settlement Layer** (Avalanche)
   - A minimal on-chain `Escrow` contract (Solidity, deployed to Fuji via Hardhat) locks/releases AVAX for a deal
   - Private Swap for anonymous swaps (interface reserved, not yet integrated)
   - Instant Session keys for sub-second mesh-side agent authority delegation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.91+ (needed by the `alloy` EVM crate; run `rustup update stable`)
- **Node.js** 18+
- **Ollama** (for AI agent) - [Install](https://ollama.ai)
- **Nargo** (for Noir circuits, optional) - [Install](https://noir-lang.org)

### Installation

```bash
cd cabalmesh
npm install
```

### Deploy the Escrow contract (once, to Fuji testnet)

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in PRIVATE_KEY of a Fuji-funded test wallet (faucet: https://faucet.avax.network/)
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network fuji
```

This writes the deployed address to `contracts/deployments/fuji.json` and the ABI to `src-tauri/abi/Escrow.abi.json` + `src/abi/Escrow.abi.json`. Copy the deployed address into `src-tauri/.env` as `ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` (see `src-tauri/.env.example`).

### Run Development Server

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

This will:
1. Start the Vite dev server (frontend)
2. Initialize the Rust Tauri backend
3. Launch the mesh network with mDNS discovery
4. Open the Nexus UI

## 💻 Usage

### The Nexus Interface

The main UI displays:

- **Central Radar**: Pulsing violet circle representing your mesh presence
- **Peer Dots**: Violet dots appear as nearby nodes are discovered
- **Status Bar**: Shows Internet, Mesh Nodes count, and Privacy level
- **Intent Composer**: Command bar at bottom for entering privacy intents
- **Thought Stream**: Live log of operations on the right side

### Example Intent

```
Buy 10 AVAX under $95 using Shark Mode
```

The system will:
1. Generate a Noir ZK-proof of your balance
2. Negotiate via Ollama AI (localhost:11434)
3. Broadcast encrypted intent to mesh
4. Settle via the on-chain Escrow contract on Avalanche when online

### Going Offline

1. **Disconnect Wi-Fi** - The Internet LED turns red
2. **Post Intent** - Data flows through mesh (Mesh LED stays green)
3. **Reconnect** - Settlement executes on Avalanche

## 🎨 Key Features

### 1. Offline Intent Execution
Post tasks while completely offline. Local mesh agents relay, negotiate, and sign deals, only hitting Avalanche when an internet gateway is reached.

### 2. Verifiable Aggression
Noir proofs ensure your AI agent followed your "Aggressive" strategy without cheating or leaking your price ceiling.

### 3. Sybil-Resistant ZK-Reputation
Nodes prove honesty via zero-knowledge without revealing interaction history.

### 4. On-Chain Escrow
Deals lock native AVAX in a minimal `Escrow.sol` contract (deposit → release, or depositor/expiry-based refund) instead of being purely simulated.

## 🧪 Testing

### Rust Backend

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo check  # Verify compilation
cargo test   # Run tests (when added)
```

### Frontend

```bash
npm run build    # Production build
npm run preview  # Preview build
```

### Smart Contract

```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat test   # Runs against Hardhat's in-memory network, no real funds
```

### Multi-Node Mesh Test

1. Run two instances on different network interfaces
2. Watch mDNS peer discovery in console
3. Send intent from one node
4. Observe Gossipsub propagation

## 🔐 Privacy Layers

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Physical** | Libp2p + mDNS | Hide IP/location |
| **Negotiation** | Ollama + FHE | Protect strategy |
| **Verification** | Noir ZK | Prove without revealing |
| **Settlement** | On-chain Escrow (Avalanche) | Trustless deal settlement |

## 🗺️ Roadmap / Deferred Ideas

### Buyer/seller LLM-to-LLM price negotiation
Currently, buying only matches a buyer's intent against a listing's **fixed** price (`match_intent_to_listings` in `src-tauri/src/matcher.rs`) — there's no back-and-forth negotiation between the two sides' local agents. A real version of this would need:
- A negotiation protocol over the mesh (offer → counter-offer → accept/reject message types, similar in spirit to the existing `relay_tx`/`content_request` intent types in `mesh.rs`).
- Hard guardrails enforced in Rust (not trusted to the model): the buyer's agent must never bid above the user's price ceiling, the seller's agent must never accept below their floor.
- A round limit, so two agents can't loop forever.

**Known risk:** the local model (llama2 via Ollama) is not very reliable — see the JSON-parsing robustness fixes in `src-tauri/src/llm_json.rs`, needed because the model often doesn't follow "respond only with JSON" instructions. A multi-turn negotiation multiplies that risk (inconsistent replies between rounds, possible bad-price "agreement" from a parsing slip). Deferred until the single-shot matching flow is solid.
